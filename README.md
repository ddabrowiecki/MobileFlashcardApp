# Mobile Flashcard App

## About

This mobile app is the final project in the React-Redux nanodegree program offered by Udacity.  Here, we demonstrate our knowledge of React Native by building
a simple application for a digital version of flashcards one would use to study for an exam. Users can access decks of flashcards, quiz themselves using the 
flashcards as well as adding both questions and decks persisted to AsyncStorage as well as a Redux store.

## Installation

This project requires `yarn` or `npm` to be installed to run the development server.

For yarn, please visit [this page](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to install.

For npm, run the following command: `npm install`

Once this is done, `git clone` this repository into a directory of your choice.  Then:

1) `cd Your-Chosen-Directory`
2) `yarn start`
OR
`npm start`

## Testing

This app was manually tested using Expo and an Android device.  Given that the program is written in React Native, the app should also function on iOS, but
this hasn't been tested.

## Attributions

This app was developed with significant use of Udacity lectures as well as the Udacity Knowlege Base, where students ask questions, post code and collaborate.
